Executable
-----------

The following instructions provide guidance to create a runtime executable.

The 'PortfolioFinder' application is a GUI-based application written in Python. For convenience, a runtime executable
has been created allowing users to simply download and run without the need to setup their machine with specific 
components.

*Note*:  The current platform targeted is Windows.  However, future updates will also generate a runtime for MacOS.

There are many options to create a runtime executable.  For now, we have chosen the 'pyinstaller' utility, but that may change.


Using pyinstaller:

> pyinstaller --noconsole --splash=Splash.png --onefile -n PortfolioFinder app.py

This will generate the .exe file within a 'dist' folder.  However, the full runtime package requires the following files:

	o README.md						# Readme instructions for the utility
	o LSEG.ico               		# Icon image loaded by the application
	o refinitiv-data.config.json	# Application configuration file responsible for credentials to access portfolio data
