Executable
-----------

The following instructions provide guidance to create a runtime executable.

The 'PortfolioFinder' application is a GUI-based application written in Python. For convenience, a runtime executable
has been created and uploaded within the Developer Portal allowing users to download and run without the need to setup 
their machine with specific software.

*Note*:  The current platform targeted is Windows.  However, future updates could also generate a runtime for MacOS.

There are a number of available options to create a runtime executable.  For now, we have chosen the 'pyinstaller' utility.


Using pyinstaller:

> pyinstaller --noconsole --splash=Splash.png --icon=assets/LSEG.ico --onefile -n PortfolioFinder PortfolioFinder.py

This will generate the .exe file within a 'dist' folder.  However, the full runtime package requires the following files:

	o README.md                    # Readme instructions for the utility
	o refinitiv-data.config.json   # Application configuration file responsible for credentials to access portfolio data
	o assets                       # Entire directory contain the assets required by the application
